# Methods

##Site and species surveys

This study was located at La Selva Biological Research Station in Heredia, Costa Rica (84&deg;00’12W, 10&deg;25’52N). This site is a 600 hectare wet tropical forest, with elevation ranging from 35-137m above sea level. The site receives 4m of annual rainfall with a moderate dry season. Annual mean temperatures fluctuates between between 24-27 &deg;C, while daily temperatures can fluctuate up to 12 &deg;C (McDade et al. 1994). 

\

At least once per year (insert methods from Diedra) newly formed fronds of *Saccoloma inaequale* (n = ?) were color tagged according to year. Fronds generally lasted from 3-4 years, with dissappearance mostly occuring from stem fall distubance. 

## Physiological measurements

A survey of physiological and stoichiometric parameters was conducted on all present age classes of fronds for a subset of 10 *S. inaequale* individuals. For leaf gas exchange measurements, a LiCor 6400 portable photosynthesis system (LiCor BioSciences) was used with the standard leaf chamber (2 x 3 cm) equipped with blue-red light emitting diodes. The CO~2~ mixer  was set to 400 μmol m^-2^ sec^-1^ and leaf temperature was maintained at 25 &deg;C. Gas exchange parameters were logged once CO~2~ and water vapor fluxes were stable. Net photosynthetic rate (An) and stomatal conductance (g~s~) were logged at a standard photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) level of 500 $\mu$mol m^-2^ s^-1^,which has been previously shown to produce maximum photosynthetic rates for tropical understory terrestrial plants (Watkins et al 2010). All in situ gas exchange measurements were conducted during mid-morning hours. 

## Leaf chemistry

Foliar tissue was collected following gas exchange measurements and used for nutrient and istopte analyses. Samples were dried to a constant mass and ground to a powder. Foliar $\delta$^13^C, carbon content and nitrogen content were measured using a Cornell machine (insert specs). The percentage of carbon and nitrogen in samples was calculated by comparison with certified standards and and isotopic signatures are reported relative to the standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite scale. Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) was defined as the ratio of photosynthesis to leaf N content on a mass basis.

##Chlorophyll content

For each Selaginella species, subsamples of fresh foliar tissue used during gas exchange measurements were used to calculate chlorophyll content (Chl). Specs for cholorphyll meter requested from Pitterman.

# Preliminary data summary

Below are the boxplots (excluding outliers) for physiological measurements, including; photosynthesis (A~n~), stomatal conductance (g~s~), instantaneous water use efficiency (ITE), transpiration (E~l~) and chlorophyll content. Gas exchange was performed on a subset of individuals (n=10).

There is an issue with the gas exchange data from some fronds for individual #26 (2^nd^ and 3^rd^ year fronds). I have deleted it from physiology figures at the moment. I pasted the raw deleted data at the bottom so you can have a look.

\

```{r gas exchange, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
par(mar=c(5,5,1,1))
boxplot(Photo ~ leafage, data=alldata_no26, ylab=photolab, ylim=c(0,5), col=frondcols2,outline=FALSE)

boxplot(Cond ~ leafage, data=alldata_no26[alldata_no26$Cond > 0 & alldata_no26$Cond < .45,], outline=FALSE, ylab=condlab,col=frondcols2, ylim=c(0, .5))

boxplot(Ci~leafage, data=alldata_no26[alldata_no26$Ci > 0,], ylab=cilab,col=frondcols2, outline=FALSE, ylim=c(300, 400))
```

\

```{r iwue, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
par(mar=c(5,5,1,1))
boxplot(iwue ~ leafage, data=alldata_no26[alldata_no26$iwue > 0,], outline=FALSE, col=frondcols2, ylab=itelab)

boxplot(Trmmol ~ leafage, data=alldata_no26, outline=FALSE, col=frondcols,
        ylab=Elab)
```
Instantaneous water use efficiency looks like it declines in year 3,likely driven by transpiration instead of A~n~

\

```{r chl, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
par(mar=c(5,5,1,1))
boxplot(chl ~ leafage, data=alldata, ylim=c(300, 700), col=frondcols2, outline=FALSE,ylab=chllab)

```

### Traits by leaf age

```{r phys, echo=FALSE}

par(mar=c(5,5.5,1,1))
boxplot(amass/nmass ~ leafage, data=alldata_no26,col=frondcols2, outline=FALSE,ylab=nuelab)

```

### Transpiration data seems bad for certain ages for #26
```{r baddat,}
photo[photo$Indiv == 26, c("Indiv", "Photo", "Cond", "Trmmol", "Ci")] 
```
